# this is a test to see if commiting to github works

fix issue with high score only saving when game is closed, not when player dies

Controls:
- WASD or Arrow Keys to move
- Spacebar to shoot
- Hold TAB to move twice as fast
- Alt + Enter to toggle full screen
- Esc to pause

Some assets and code used from Clear Code tutorials ~
"The ultimate introduction to Pygame" https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk
"Creating Space Invaders in Pygame/Python:" https://youtu.be/o-6pADy5Mdg

Asset Changes to Make:
- Replace Galaga ship with original player sprite
- Replace with Space Invaders with original enemy sprites
- Add original sound effects

Audio Problems:
sound effects sound like ping pong balls after adding second music channel, adding sound effects to their own channels fixed this but can only play one after another
(if laser fires twice in a row you will only here it once)

Try https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html instead of the sound class for music, gives more control like queue music.

Use 'channel_#.play(music, -1)' to loop instead?

Things to Add:
- Show controls in game
- High score and save
- Menu and options, allow player to change volume and difficulty
- Add healthbar, player should explode on death and appear from bottom of screen
- get extra lives, maybe items that float down or reward for high score?
- Quit game option
- Enemy animations
- fix transparency issue in explosion animation
- Explosion animations for player / give time to show animation before game ends
- Player explosion should delay game over screen
- Music Channels
- Bosses
- Multiple levels/stages
- decrease score if aliens get past player?
- speed boost that uses energy?
