Some assets and code used from Clear Code tutorials ~
"The ultimate introduction to Pygame" https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk
"Creating Space Invaders in Pygame/Python:" https://youtu.be/o-6pADy5Mdg

Asset Changes to Make:
- Replace Galaga ship with original player sprite
- Replace with Space Invaders with original enemy sprites
- Add original sound effects

Audio Problems:
sound effects sound like ping pong balls after adding second music channel, adding sound effects to their own channels fixed this but can only play one after another
(if laser fires twice in a row you will only here it once)

Try https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html instead of the sound class for music, gives more control like queue music.

Use 'channel_#.play(music, -1)' to loop instead?

GameManager vs StateManager:
- Include a state manager class to manage game_active status (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9yMFG3D7fg)
- Figure out how to integrate this with the game manager class

Refactoring:
- Add timer class, remove this responsibility from GameManager

Things to Add:
- Display sprites of aliens on screen with how many points they are worth
- Allow player to enter initials if they get the high score
- Figure out how to use increasing score to increase rate of alien and laser spawn
- Show controls in game (create images with WASD, Spacebar and arrow keys, etc)
- Menu and options, allow player to change volume and difficulty
- Add healthbar, player should explode on death and appear from bottom of screen
- get extra lives, maybe items that float down or reward for high score?
- Quit game option
- Enemy animations
- fix transparency issue in explosion animation
- Music Channels
- Bosses
- Multiple levels/stages
- speed boost that uses energy?
